"I²S audio interface project"

I²S (Inter-IC Sound) is a **serial communication protocol** developed by Philips for transmitting **digital audio data** between integrated circuits. It is specifically designed for **audio applications**, where high-quality, synchronized transmission of stereo sound is required.

Unlike general-purpose serial protocols such as SPI or I²C, I²S is optimized for audio data and ensures correct **channel alignment and timing**.

 **Purpose**

The I²S protocol is used to transfer **pulse-code modulated (PCM)** audio data in digital form between devices such as:
 Microcontrollers
 Digital signal processors (DSPs)
 Digital-to-analog converters (DACs)
 Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)
 Audio codecs
 Digital microphones

This avoids the loss of quality that can occur in analog transmission and simplifies system design.

 **Key Features**

 **Dedicated audio data lines** — separate clock and channel signals to ensure accurate data alignment.
 **High fidelity** — designed for audio sample rates and resolutions.
 **Stereo data support** — handles left and right audio channels with precise synchronization.
 **Simple structure** — uses a small number of signals, typically three or four.
 **MSB-first** — data is transmitted most significant bit first.

 **Main Signals**

1. **BCLK (Bit Clock)**
   Drives the data line, determining how fast bits are transmitted.
   Frequency depends on sample rate, bit depth, and number of channels.

2. **LRCLK (Word Select / Left-Right Clock)**
   Indicates which channel’s data is being transmitted:
    Low → Left channel
    High → Right channel

3. **SD (Serial Data)**
   Carries the PCM audio data.

 **Data Format**

 PCM format (2’s complement) is standard.
 Data for each channel is transmitted sequentially.
 Typical resolutions: 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit. Here i used 8-bit.
 MSB (Most Significant Bit) is sent first.
 Left channel data is transmitted first.

 **Applications**

 Audio playback and recording systems.
 Microcontroller-based sound systems.
 Digital audio players.
 Digital microphones.
 Audio interfaces in consumer electronics.
 Audio processing in DSPs.
